# EV_Trends_And_Market_Analysis

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of electric vehicle (EV) trends, focusing on various aspects such as adoption rates, popular models, manufacturers, and the evolution of EV technology. The analysis includes visualizations and insights derived from a comprehensive dataset on EV registrations.

## Key Insights
#### 1. EV Adoption Over Time
The analysis reveals a significant increase in EV adoption, particularly from 2017 onwards. The number of registered EVs rose modestly until 2016, then accelerated rapidly, with 2023 marking the highest peak in registrations.

#### 2. EV Registrations by City and County
EV registrations in top cities show that Seattle leads significantly, followed by Bellevue and Redmond. King County dominates in EV registrations compared to Snohomish and Pierce counties, with notable registrations in Bothell (Snohomish County) and Tacoma (Pierce County).

#### 3. EV Type Preferences
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are more popular or preferred over Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) among the registered electric vehicles in the United States.

#### 4. Manufacturer Dominance
TESLA has the highest number of registered vehicles, followed by NISSAN and CHEVROLET. Other manufacturers like FORD, BMW, KIA, TOYOTA, VOLKSWAGEN, JEEP, and HYUNDAI also have significant registrations.

#### 5. Popular EV Models
TESLA's MODEL Y and MODEL 3 have the highest registrations, with MODEL Y leading. NISSAN's LEAF is the most registered non-TESLA model. Other significant models include TESLA's MODEL S and MODEL X, and CHEVROLET's BOLT EV and VOLT.

#### 6. Electric Range Distribution
The distribution of the mean electric range among electric vehicles shows:

* A high frequency of vehicles with a low electric range, peaking just before 50 miles.
* A right-skewed distribution, with a long tail extending towards higher ranges, though vehicles with higher ranges are much less frequent.
* The mean electric range for this set of vehicles is approximately 58.84 miles, indicating that most vehicles have a relatively low range.

#### 7. Evolution of EV Range
The progression of the average electric range of EVs from around 2000 to 2024 indicates:

* A general upward trend in the average range, reflecting technological improvements.
* A peak around 2020, marking the highest average range observed.
* A drop after 2020, possibly due to incomplete data or the introduction of lower-range models.
* A slight recovery in the average range in the most recent year.

#### 8. Top Models by Range
The TESLA ROADSTER has the highest average electric range, with TESLA models dominating the top positions. The CHEVROLET BOLT EV stands out among CHEVROLET models, while NISSAN's LEAF and CHEVROLET's SPARK have more modest average ranges.

## Conclusion
The analysis indicates a growing and diversifying EV market, with significant contributions from TESLA in terms of both market share and technological innovation. The range variability highlights ongoing challenges and opportunities in battery technology and market offerings.
